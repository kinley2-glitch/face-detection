# Face-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

Face detection -- also called facial detection -- is an artificial intelligence (AI) based computer technology used to find and identify human faces in digital images. Face detection technology can be applied to various fields -- including security, biometrics, law enforcement, entertainment and personal safety -- to provide surveillance and tracking of people in real time.

Face detection has progressed from rudimentary computer vision techniques to advances in machine learning (ML) to increasingly sophisticated artificial neural networks (ANN) and related technologies; the result has been continuous performance improvements. It now plays an important role as the first step in many key applications -- including face tracking, face analysis and facial recognition. Face detection has a significant effect on how sequential operations will perform in the application.

## Steps
1. Creating a video frame
   Collect a video of the person you want to add into face detection system of atleast - 20 secs

2. Extracting image frame 
   Using open-cv extract the image frame from the videos
