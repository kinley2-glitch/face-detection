# Face-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

Face detection, also known as facial detection, is a computer technology that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to find and recognize human faces in digital photographs. Face detection technology can be used to enable real-time surveillance and tracking of people in a variety of industries, such as security, biometrics, law enforcement, entertainment, and personal safety.

Face identification has advanced from simple computer vision approaches to increasingly complex artificial neural networks (ANN) and associated technologies, with the end result being constant performance gains. Face tracking, face analysis, and facial recognition are just a few of the significant applications it now serves as the starting point for. Sequential operations in the application will function significantly differently depending on face detection.

## Steps
1. Creating a video frame
   Collect a video of the person you want to add into face detection system of atleast - 20 secs

2. Extracting image frame 
   Using open-cv extract the image frame from the videos
   
## How to use the code?
1. git clone https://github.com/kinley2-glitch/face-detection-using-deep-learning
2. Edit the code to your convinience
